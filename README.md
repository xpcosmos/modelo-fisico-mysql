**Modelo Físico MySQL**

This project serves as a practical demonstration of my learning journey with MySQL databases. It utilizes a MySQL database server set up on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (RHEL 9) virtual machine (VM). 

**Database System:** 

MySQL

**Project Structure:**

The project structure can be adapted to your preference. Here's a suggestion for organization:

```
modelo_fisico_mysql/
├── database          
│   ├── schema.sql              
├── README.md
```

**Purpose:**

This project provides a hands-on experience with key aspects of MySQL database management, including:

* Setting up a basic MySQL database structure (schema)
* Setting up a VM able to be used by external users in the same Network
* Management acess and permission to interact with the database 
* Writing SQL queries to interact with the database


**Exploring the Database:**

The `database` folder contains various SQL scripts that demonstrate different functionalities. These scripts can be executed once you connect to the MySQL server on your VM. 

**Note:** You'll need to have a separate setup process for the VM and database (not included in this project) to connect and run the scripts. 

**Remember:**

* Modify the project structure as needed to suit your organization preferences.
* This project serves as a learning tool for personal development.
